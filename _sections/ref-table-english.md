It can be helpful to use a template to build an XLSForm rather than starting from a blank document. The template provided below includes some helpful styling rules as well as extensive reference that is kept updated as XLSForm and the tools that use it evolve. You can use it to see which functionality is supported by Collect and Enketo and get ideas on how to meet your form design goals.
